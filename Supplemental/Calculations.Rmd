# Calculations

## Goals

> 1. Build a function which calculates mean, standard deviation, and five number summary for quantitative variables or the proportion for categorical ones, given a dataframe and a column




```{r figure1}
# Figure 1 involves the six basic demographics: gender (18), age (19), income (26), student (27), ethnicity (21), housing status (23)
the_six_basic = c(18, 19, 26, 27, 21, 23)
get_important_math(the_six_basic, categorical = TRUE)


```

It is with blithe spirit that I receive this news, that the function works with categorical values. Now, we commence with quantitative ones.

``` {r figure2}
# Figure 2 is house price ratings (9) from owners and renters (23)
owners = fullsomerville2017 %>% filter(`6. Describe your housing status in Somerville.` == "Own")
renters = fullsomerville2017 %>% filter(`6. Describe your housing status in Somerville.` == "Rent")

get_important_math_for_OwnRent = function(column, own = owners, rent = renters) {
  print("For Owners,")
  get_important_math(column = column, dataframe = own)
  print("")
  print("For Renters,")
  get_important_math(column = column, dataframe = rent)
}

get_important_math_for_OwnRent(9)
```

Also yay, now it works for numbers, too!

``` {r figure3}
