# Data Cleanup
This is a record of the rationale behind data cleanup
choices.

## Demographics
### Gender
So, a notable quantity of the survey responses are
inconsistent and need to be standardized. For example,

- (Female and Male selected)
- Female + Male checked
- Checked Female & Male

There are several explanations for these responses. 
First, that they are, in fact, gender fluid, non-binary, 
intersex, etc., and second, that they are a household
with more than one person and this reflects that. 
Other responses show this ambiguity more:

- Two People filled this out
- non binary female
- both make \[sic\] and female checked
- I don't believe in the social construct of gender

Because of the ambiguity, ```both male and female selected``` will
remain distinct from ```multiple people```. Genderqueer
responses are awesome and I'm still decided how to 
handle them \[2020.10.07\].
