# Exploration

The 2017 survey data was cleaned up in Python (see `data_cleanup_changelog.md`) and exported into the `cleanedData` folder. 

## Goals (Nov/11/2020)

> 1. Find Somerville population demographics to compare our sample demographics to
  - Useful starting point: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/somervillecitymassachusetts/PST045219

### Who are the renters? Who are the owners?

One striking discovery is that renters and owners of homes differ noticeably in their responses to house prices (of course), night safety, and police trust. So who are the renters, and who are the owners?

``` {r own_v_rent}
for (col in all_rating_questions) {
  rent_own(column = col, xticks = 10)
}

for (col in all_categorical_questions) {
  rent_own(column = col, xticks = 10, categorical = TRUE)
}

renters_by_income = renters %>% dplyr::mutate(`9. What is your annual household income?` = factor(`9. What is your annual household income?`, levels=c("Less than $10,000", "$10,000 to $24,999", "$25,000 to $49,999", "$50,000 to 74,999", "$75,000 to $99,999", "$100,000 to $149,999", "$150,000 or more")))
renters_by_income %>% ggplot(aes_string(x="`9. What is your annual household income?`", fill="`6. Describe your housing status in Somerville.`")) + geom_bar(color = "black") + labs(x = "", y = "", title = "`9. What is your annual household income?`") + scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue1")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 75)) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(vjust = 0.5))
#ggsave(device = "png", filename = stringcombiner("RentByInc", "`9. What is your annual household income?`"), path = "images/")

owners_by_income = owners %>% dplyr::mutate(`9. What is your annual household income?` = factor(`9. What is your annual household income?`, levels=c("Less than $10,000", "$10,000 to $24,999", "$25,000 to $49,999", "$50,000 to 74,999", "$75,000 to $99,999", "$100,000 to $149,999", "$150,000 or more")))
