# Math453GroupProject

We're a group of students from California State University Channel Islands practicing statistics using R and the Somerville Happiness Survey responses from 2017.

The original survey data is in the `data` folder. Responses were cleaned and made consistent using `data_cleanup.py` and exported to the `cleanedData` folder. Visualizations were produced with `exploration.Rmd` and exported to the `images` folder. A few images of interest were combined using GIMP into single figures (see `GIMP_workspace`, and the current working draft of the final paper is `first_draft.Rmd`.

What still remains to be done is calculating the mean, standard deviation, and five-number summaries for each graph used in the paper, so we have numbers to support our claims.
