# This script will smallify the original data by dropping
# columns or unwanted years, ages, etc.

# Then it will save each produced data set into unique
# *.csv files so we have a beautiful paper trail of all
# the changes we make.

# If, for example, we want a histogram of Housing Price
# Opinion vs. Gender, we only need those two columns. So 
# we should create it and save the result in, like, 
# `house_opinion_vs_gender_2017.csv`

# Useful shortcuts: CTRL+S saves, CTRL+ALT+R runs the
# entire script. (The run button above just runs the 
# highlighted region or a single line)
