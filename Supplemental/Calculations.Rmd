# Calculations

## Goals

> 1. Build a function which calculates mean, standard deviation, and five number summary for quantitative variables or the proportion for categorical ones, given a dataframe and a column




```{r figure1}
# Figure 1 involves the six basic demographics: gender (18), age (19), income (26), student (27), ethnicity (21), housing status (23)
the_six_basic = c(18, 19, 26, 27, 21, 23)
get_important_math(the_six_basic, categorical = TRUE)


```

It is with blithe spirit that I receive this news, that the function works with categorical values. Now, we commence with quantitative ones.

``` {r figure2}
# Figure 2 is house price ratings (9) from owners and renters (23)
owners = fullsomerville2017 %>% filter(`6. Describe your housing status in Somerville.` == "Own")
renters = fullsomerville2017 %>% filter(`6. Describe your housing status in Somerville.` == "Rent")

get_important_math_for_OwnRent = function(column, own = owners, rent = renters) {
  print("For Owners,")
  get_important_math(column = column, dataframe = own)
  print("")
  print("For Renters,")
  get_important_math(column = column, dataframe = rent)
}

get_important_math_for_OwnRent(9)
hypothesis_testing(column = 9, dataframe_H_0 = owners, dataframe_H_A = renters, alpha = 0.05, beta_mean = 2.012987)

# testdataframe = data.frame(alpha = 0.05, lower_rejection = 2.41747572815534, prob_type_2 = 2.44625431022882e-11)
for (i in c(1:9)) {  # was c(1:999), shortened for space
  mu_null = mean(pull(owners, 9))
  x_bar = mean(pull(renters, 9))
  sample_stdev = sd(pull(renters, 9))
  sqrt_n = sqrt(length(pull(renters, 9)))
  Z = (x_bar - mu_null) / (sample_stdev / sqrt_n)
  alpha = 0.5 - (0.0005 * i)
  rejection_region_below = qnorm(alpha) * (sample_stdev / sqrt_n) + mu_null
  prob_type_2_error_below = 1 - pnorm((rejection_region_below - x_bar) / (sample_stdev / sqrt_n))
  print(paste(alpha, rejection_region_below, prob_type_2_error_below, sep = ","))
  # testdataframe <- rbind(testdataframe, c(alpha, rejection_region_below, prob_type_2_error_below))
}

```

Also yay, now it works for numbers, too!
